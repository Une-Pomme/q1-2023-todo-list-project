# To Do List Project
This is the project built for the "Section 27: React and Typescript" section of Oak Academy's "Typescript & React JS Course with React & Typescript Project" Udemy course.

## What I got out of this project
- When there is JSX in a Typescript file, the file extension is .tsx
- Best practice is to define the props of a class component with a TypeScript Interface
- When we incorporate TypeScript in a functional component, we add in an annotation for the prop object (which will usually an interface), and we add in a return type annotation (which will usually be a JSX element)
- TypeScript has built-in enums (currently in COI, we use a JS work around for the front end)
- TypeScript only works during developement (the browser and Node.Js have no "Knowledge" of TypeScript)
- It doesn't help performance optimization
